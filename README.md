Micro Reddit Homepage

This project is attempting to create a portable, in-device homepage contained within just one single HTML file for my favorite subreddits. I have a personal account that I also use but enjoy browsing them individually as well, especially using my cellphone's browser. I often find myself frequently editing the URL, changing the subreddit and view (hot, top), and also switching between time ranges of a day or a week for the top view. My idea was to create a very small homepage that could reside locally on the device, allowing me to quickly perform these actions without having to edit the URL.

On top of that, I just added the capability of peeking subreddits content from the Reddit API, which does a cool quick preview.

This is how it looks. Subreddits can be edited in the file itself or passed as the 's' parameter in the URL:

Favourite subreddits can be stored straight in the bookmark as is describe in the page header.
