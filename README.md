Micro Reddit Homepage

This project is an attempt to create a portable, in-device homepage, contained in just one single html file for my favourite subreddits. I have an account that I also use, but like as well to individually browse them, especially using my cellphone's browser, and I found myself frequently endup editing the URL, changing the subreddit and the view (hot, top, and normally changing the top range between a day and a week). My idea was to create a very small homepage that could reside locally in the device, that could allow me to quickly do that without having to edit the URL. This is how it looks:

Is a very simple project, but very useful to me. Hope you like it as well. Favourite subreddits can be stored in a bookmark f.e.
